Below are steps on performing the basic functionality of the Abstractanator:

I/O:

1. Importing Images: To import an image into the Abstractanator, click on the "Import" button on the top right of the application. This will open up a file selector in which you can navigate to wherever your desired image is located on your device. Currently, the Abstractanator accepts .jpg, .png, and .gif file formats. 

2. Exporting Images: To export an image that you have abstracted, click on the "Export" button on the top right of the application. This will open up a file selector in which you can navigate to wherever you would like to save the exported image. Currently, the Abstractanator exports images as .png files.

ABSTRACTION FUNCTIONS:

1. Polarizer: To apply the polarizer abstraction to a loaded in image, first select the number of iterations that you would like the Abstractanator to run the polarizer abstraction on the current image by changing the JSpinner to the left of the "Polarize" button to the desired number. If the JSpinner is set to 0, the Abstractanator will default to 1 iteration. After clicking the "Polarize" button, the image will have the polarizer abstraction applied to it and the display will update to reflect this change, along with the history panel. 

2. Color Polarizer: To apply the color polarizer abstraction to a loaded in image, first select the number of iterations that you would like the Abstractanator to run the color polarizer abstraction on the current image by changing the JSpinner to the left of the "Color Polarizer" button to the desired number. If the JSpinner is set to 0, the Abstractanator will default to 1 iteration. After clicking the "Color Polarizer" button, the image will have the color polarizer abstraction applied to it and the display will update to reflect this change, along with the history panel. 

3. RGB Randomizer: To apply the RGB randomizer abstraction to a loaded in image, first select the number of iterations that you would like the Abstractanator to run the RGB randomizer abstraction on the current image by changing the JSpinner to the left of the "RGB" button to the desired number. If the JSpinner is set to 0, the Abstractanator will default to 1 iteration. After clicking the "RGB" button, the image will have the RGB randomizer abstraction applied to it and the display will update to reflect this change, along with the history panel. 

4. Folding/Unfolding: To apply the folding abstraction to a loaded in image, first select the direction of the fold that you would like to occur by changing the JSpinner value next to the "Fold" button to the desired fold. The folding numbers are described below. After pressing the "Fold" button, the current image will be folded (if the image is not already folded), and the main display will update to reflect this change, along with the history panel. To unfold an image that is folded, simply click on the "Unfold" button and the display will update to display this change, along with the history panel.

Folding Constants:
1 = Fold left
2 = Fold right
3 = Fold top
4 = Fold bottom

HISTORY:

1. Undo: To undo any action that has been performed inside the abstractanator, simply click on the "Undo" button on the top left of the application, and the application will revert to the most recent change that was made, up until there are no more changes to revert.
